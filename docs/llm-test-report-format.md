### Crash Report Content

```
ETHERVOXAI LLM SUBSYSTEM CRASH REPORT
=====================================

Timestamp: Mon Jan 1 12:00:50 2024

Signal: SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault)

Context: Test 8: Long Runtime Stress Test
Query Number: 15 of 30

Details:
The LLM subsystem encountered a crash during execution.
This crash was caught by the crash detection system and
the test suite was able to recover and continue.

Recovery: SUCCESS - Test suite continued after crash

Recommendations:
- Check model file integrity
- Review recent LLM subsystem changes
- Verify memory management in tool execution
- Run stress test again to check for reproducibility
- Check system resources (memory, disk space)

Debug Information:
- Governor instance: Valid
- Model loaded: Yes
- Tools registered: Yes
- Memory store: Valid

End of crash report
```

## Using Reports for Debugging

### High Failure Rate

Check the report for:
- Which specific tests failed
- Tool invocation patterns
- Response content (hallucinations vs tool usage)

Actions:
- Review system prompt in `src/llm/tool_registry.c`
- Verify tool descriptions are clear
- Try different model (Phi-3.5 recommended)

### Crashes Detected

Check crash reports for:
- Signal type (SIGSEGV = memory issue, SIGABRT = assertion failure)
- Which test was running
- Query number in stress test

Actions:
- Run valgrind to detect memory issues
- Check recent code changes in failing area
- Verify model file integrity
- Test with minimal configuration

### Intermittent Failures

If stress test shows variable success rate:
- Check system resources (memory, CPU)
- Look for race conditions in tool execution
- Verify thread safety of tool implementations
- Monitor memory usage during test

## Report Retention

Recommended retention policy:
- Keep last 10 test reports
- Archive crash reports indefinitely
- Delete old reports after 30 days (if no crashes)

Automation:
```bash
# Clean old test reports (keep last 10)
ls -t llm_test_report_*.log | tail -n +11 | xargs rm -f

# Archive crash reports
mkdir -p crash_reports_archive
mv llm_test_crash_*.log crash_reports_archive/ 2>/dev/null
```
