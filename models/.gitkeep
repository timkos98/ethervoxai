# Models Directory

This directory contains LLM model files for EthervoxAI.

## Purpose

- Stores downloaded GGUF model files for local inference
- The governor model (e.g., `granite-4.0-h-tiny-Q4_K_M.gguf`) should be placed here
- This directory is preserved during build clean operations
- Model files are excluded from git tracking (see `.gitignore`)

## Usage

Download models using the provided script:
```bash
./scripts/download-governor-model.sh
```

Or manually place compatible GGUF models here.

## Important Notes

⚠️ **This directory is protected:**
- The `scripts/build.sh --clean` command will NOT delete this folder
- `.gitignore` excludes `*.gguf` files (they're too large for git)
- Symlinks to model directories are also preserved

## Recommended Models

- **granite-4.0-h-tiny-Q4_K_M.gguf** - Default governor model (lightweight)
- **Phi-3.5-mini-instruct** - Recommended for tool usage
- **Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct** - Alternative compact model

Model files should be in GGUF format and compatible with llama.cpp.
