## EthervoxAI — Copilot instructions for editing and codegen

This file gives short, repo-specific guidance for AI coding assistants working on EthervoxAI.

Be concise. Prefer minimal, testable changes and cite the files below when referencing architecture.

- Big picture
  - Primary implementation: TypeScript/Node.js (root repository). Key directories and files: `README.md`, `docs/`, `implementations/`, `scripts/`.
  - Multi-language targets: `implementations/python/`, `implementations/cpp/`, `implementations/micropython/`. Keep changes to cross-language interfaces in `specs/` or `specs/ethervoxai-protocol.md`.
  - Main modules to inspect before edits: the modules listed in `README.md` under `src/modules/` (multilingualRuntime, localLLMStack, privacyDashboard, modelManager, inferenceEngine, platformDetector, crossPlatformAudio).

- Developer workflows (commands to run)
  - Install deps: `npm install`
  - Build core: `npm run build`
  - Run demo: `npm run demo` (Windows-specific demo: `npm run demo:windows`)
  - Audio tests: `npm run test:audio`
  - Web/mobile UI builds are optional and require installing React/React Native separately (`npm run build:web`, `npm run build:mobile`). See README for details.

- Project conventions and patterns
  - The repo has one authoritative README that lists canonical module names and locations; prefer referencing it when adding or changing modules.
  - **ESP32 source mirroring**: `esp32-project/src/` and `esp32-project/include/` are symlinks to `../src` and `../include`. Edit files in the root `src/` or `include/` directories only - changes automatically apply to both desktop and ESP32 builds. Do not duplicate .gitignore patterns for `esp32-project/`.
  - Audio systems use a fallback chain; when modifying audio code, update `config/audio.json` and ensure `CrossPlatformAudioManager` fallback logic remains intact.
  - Model management is centralized in `modelManager` (downloads, caching, compatibility). Changes that affect model files must preserve cache paths and compatibility checks.
  - Hardware detection and optimization logic live in `platformDetector`. Avoid hard-coding performance tiers; use `platformDetector.getCapabilities()`.

- Integration points & external dependencies
  - Local model files and downloads: `modelManager` interacts with remote model sources and local cache directories. Keep download logic idempotent and resumable.
  - Audio platform bindings: Windows SAPI, espeak, node-speaker, and play-sound are supported. For platform-specific code, prefer small wrappers under `scripts/` or `implementations/`.
  - CI: workflows in `.github/workflows/` run build-and-test and code-quality checks. Expect unit tests and linting to run on PRs.

- Codegen / editing rules for AI agents
  - Make the smallest change that satisfies the task. Preserve public APIs and TypeScript types unless asked to change them.
  - Prefer to add unit tests for new behavior in `tests/` when feasible. Use `npm run test` and `npm run lint` locally.
  - When touching multi-language implementations, only change the language-specific folders if the change is language-specific; otherwise, update shared `specs/` first.
  - Do not add heavyweight dependencies (e.g., React) without documenting why and updating `README.md` installation steps.
  - **License compliance**: EthervoxAI is a commercial product licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. When adding new dependencies:
    - Check license compatibility (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD are typically fine)
    - Avoid GPL/AGPL licenses that require derivative works to be open-source
    - Document third-party licenses in `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`
    - Flag any licensing concerns before adding dependencies
    - Never commit API keys, tokens, or secrets to the repository

- Examples from the codebase (where to look)
  - Hardware detection: see `platformDetector` usage in `README.md` examples and mirror its API when writing new optimizations.
  - Model recommendations: use `modelManager.getRecommendedModels()` to obtain model lists rather than embedding names.
  - Audio tests: `CrossPlatformAudioManager.testOutputMethods()` is the recommended test harness for audio changes.

- When unsure
  - Consult `README.md` and files under `docs/` (especially `docs/modules/` if present) before making design-level changes.
  - Run CI (`.github/workflows/`) locally by running `npm run build` and `npm run test` to catch lint/type errors.

If anything here is unclear or you want more detail (e.g., list of actual `src/` files), tell me which area to expand and I'll iterate.

Furthermore, you do not make "quick fixes" if there are correct solution that can be implemented with moderate effort. Always prefer correctness and maintainability over speed.
